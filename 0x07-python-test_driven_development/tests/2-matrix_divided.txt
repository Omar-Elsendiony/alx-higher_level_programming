============================
Testing ```matrix_divided``` function
============================

Usage
=========

The module ```2-matrix_divided``` contains a function ```matrix_divided``` which
divides the matrix elements by div and makes the checks that all the rows are 
equal and the matrix is a list of lists as well as ensuring that all elements
are integers or floats
======================================================
::
>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
>>> matrix = [
...    [1 , 2 , 3]
... ]

::
Dividing the matrix by an integer (elementwise)
>>> div = 2
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
[[0.5, 1.0, 1.5]]


::
Dividing the matrix by a float (elementwise)
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 1.5)
[[0.67, 1.33, 2.0]]


::
List of lists that are empty
>>> matrix = [
...    []
... ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 1.5)
[[]]

::
Matrix that is None 
>>> matrix = None
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 1.5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix(list of lists) of integers/floats


::
Division by zero
>>> div = 0
>>> matrix = [
...    [1, 2, 3],
...    [3, 4, 4],
...    [3 , 4 , 5]
... ]

::
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero


::
Matrix only a list not list of lists
>>> matrix = []
>>> div = 7
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix(list of lists) of integers/floats


::
Matrix has inconsistent size of rows
>>> matrix = [
...    [1, 2, 3],
...    [3, 4],
...    [3 , 4 , 5]
... ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size



:: different size again
>>> matrix = [
...    [1, 2],
...    [3, 4, 3],
...    [3 , 4 , 5]
... ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

>>> matrix = [
...    [1, 2, 3],
...    [3, 4, "k"],
...    [3 , 4 , 5]
... ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix(list of lists) of integers/floats
